Q10. How do you handle incomplete and missing data?

When dealing with missing or incomplete data, I first try to understand the reason for the missing data.
Depending on the situation, I may choose to impute the missing values using statistical methods or 
remove the incomplete records from the analysis. I always document the approach taken and the impact on 
the analysis results.


Q11. Can you explain a complex Data Analysis concept to someone who is not familiar with Data Analysis?


Q12. How do you ensure the quality of your analysis?
Q13. How do you stay updated with the latest trends in Data Analysis?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. HOW DO YOU HANDLE MISSING OR INCOMPLETE DATA IN A DATASET?

I typically assess the extent of missing data and the reasons behind it. 
Depending on the situation, I may choose to impute missing values using statistical methods such as mean 
imputation or use predictive models to estimate missing values.
In some cases, I may also consider removing records with missing data if they are not significant.

Q2. WHAT TECHNIQUES DO YOU USE TO IDENTIFY AND REMOVE OUTLIERS IN DATA?

There are several techniques that I commonly use to identify and remove outliers in data-
Standard Deviation Method
Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
Z-Score Method
Boxplot Method
Visulization Techniques

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CORRELATION AND CAUSATION.
Correlation describes the relationship between two variables, while causation describes
the effect that changes in one variable have on another variable.

While correlation can provide evidence of a potential casual relationship, establishing 
caustion requires further investigation and evidence.

Q2. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF YOUR ANALYSIS RESULTS?

I determine the statistical significance of my analysis using general steps involved in determining
statistical significance:
Formulate Hypothesis
Select a Significance Level (Alpha)
Choose a Statistical Test
Calculate the Test Statistic
Determine the P-value
Compare the P-value to Alpha
Interpret the results


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRAMMING AND TOOLS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. WHAT PROGRAMMING TOOLS ARE YOU EFFICIENT WITH IN FOR DATA ANALYSIS?

I am proficient in several programming tools commonly used for data analysis, including Python, R and SQL. In Python, I have experience using 
libraries such as pandas and numpy for data manipulation, analysis and machine learning. I am also comportable writing complex SQL queries to 
extract and manipulate data from relational databases. Additionally, I have used R for statistical analysis and data visualization.
Overall, I am confident in my ability to use these programming tools to perform various data analysis tasks effectively.
